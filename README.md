# EDu-GAme

My game is inspired by cs50 course itself. It contains '10 weeks Level' . If you can put sprites in 'Brain jar', you will get points resulting completing 10 weeks. On the otherhand , if you don't put sprites in brain jar, these sprites will cost you .3 points each. When you go below -1.2 week it will be game over for you. Instruction: Click mouse on sprites to select and drag them to brain jar to get points.

points:

1.Lecture=.3

2.Notes=.3

3.Projects=.4 (Projects will cost only .3 point when it is in minus)
